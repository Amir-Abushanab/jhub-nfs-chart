# jhub-nfs-chart

This is the chart for an NFS based Jupyterhub deployment. It's forked from the original Jupyterhub helm chart (v0.7.0) https://github.com/jupyterhub/helm-chart and everything applicable to it is applicable to this  

The gh-pages branch contains the actual chart, and is setup this way so that it can be pulled directly as a catalog into Rancher
